This text file contains things that are in progress or need work that have currently been implemented. It can be considered a TODO list

UPDATED 6/1/16

--HUD-- <- WAITING FOR ART
1. HUD is pretty buggy, but works fine for testing at the moment. This would be best fixed up when I have the actual HUD art

--COLLISIONS-- <- WAITING FOR ART
1. A bit buggy still. Putting him in a sphere might help/fix this issue? Perhaps
creating a "rolling" effect on collisions with a sphere may be what I'm looking for. Either way, this will be a better thing to work on
once I've got the official sprite sheet for the player.

--ACTIONS-- <- WAITING FOR ART
1. The action button is now working properly with ray casting; however, text actions still need some work. This will be better to implement
once we've developed some actual text.

--ZOOM--
1. Currently is working through HUD buttons, but eventually I would like to implement a "pinching" way to zoom in and out (for android)
while keeping the zoom buttons for the Desktop version of the game.

--IN GAME ANIMATIONS--
1. NOT YET STARTED. But these should work similar to how the actions are set up.

--CHANGING ZONES-- <- WAITING FOR ART
1. Currently works with the action button rather than on contact. On contact would be good to implement in a future patch.
I think this will be better to fix up after I have official art to work with.

--ENTITIES--
1. The Entity class is currently useless, and the AnimatedEntity class doesn't serve a huge purpose outside of supporting the Player class.
This may change as the game expands and I find more need for Entities, but as it stands these may be things I should rework or simplify down.

--BACKGROUND-- <- WAITING FOR ART
1. The main world requires a sky background to be moving underneath the main platform. 
This may be better to implement once I receive the official art, but I do currently have support for a TopDownState to have a background.
It just doesn't move at the moment.
