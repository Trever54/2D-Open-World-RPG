Summer 2016

This is a 2D-Top-Down-RPG Game meant for the Android platform. It is built off of the libGDX libraries and currently includes working Collision Detection using Box2D and a self-made algorithm. The current build is a test map where the player can walk around. The player can also enter the house; however, it only leads to another test map. Animation is also implemented and the code has a scalable structure for future development.

I was working with a 3D Art student from CSU to create this. He helped with some of the design; however the code is all written by myself. It has been put aside for now as we've both become to busy to work on such a time-consuming project; however may be picked up again in the future.
